# Reason for the project 
This project was mainly to teach others how to use and visually create a Vector Data Base use the data and run through an RAG system of a LLM of your choice. You could also use this RAG system to implement on your projects and it may be of use for more complex projects that you may have. Make sure to download the requirements for it to run and use it on your own code.

# Vector DB Architecture

This Architecture is showing how the creation of the Vector Data Base was build around with all the points and to make more visual for people that are trying to understand how the creation on the Data Base is made.

 # RAG Architecture

The RAG Architecture is a little more complex showing how you're going to retrive the data from the Vector Data Base that you have created. Showing how you're getting the query from the user and run trough the RAG system for a more complex and detailed asnwer from the LLM.

# Prerequisites And Requirements 

- You'll need to download an IDE of your choice first and have the latest version of Python on your computer.
- Make sure you have the appropriate requirements installed for it to work. 
- Make sure to add your own folder for the documents you want it to be added into your data base.
- Make sure you Have the right LLM token that you'll need to use because there is no token in it.
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Steps of Code Execution: 

- Clone / [Download this repository](https://github.com/Fernando7181/RAG_fine_tuning)
- Open the Command Window / Terminal on your system
- Trace to the respective location where the file is saved
- Run the [Create a Vector Data Base](create_database.py) ,[main](main.py) file to execute the application

# Future 

- Help out more and put in more explanation in the code and also create a larger database for the LLM to solve more issues and avoid hallucinations with the user query's
- Make sure other people can uderstand and run it locally.

# Contributing

Feel free to fork and clone this repository and make an issue or Pull Request at any time, will do my best to look at all of them and merge to the main code where we can all discuss more and talk about it.
